## Explanation

This project was made for the course: PHP 2, a course where we used Laravel for the first time.

In groups, we had to create a platform like tumblr but for the school itself, it was up to us, to make it and design it and to add functionality.

Every users needed to be able to upload his/her designs, for each upvote/comment/follow/post you would get experience, so you could go up in rank.
